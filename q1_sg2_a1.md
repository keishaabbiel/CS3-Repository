# Annex A
## Step 1. Main problem

The PSHS school canteen crowds during break times and lunch periods. The vendors lack a system and is done with manual labor, proving inefficient.

## Step 2. Sub problems

1. No system for food stock - Food stock is not tracked correctly, so it would take time to manually view the inventory and see what to order in bulk. This would take days before an, essentially popular, item is restocked.
2. Long queues - Students are affected by the long waiting times. In unlucky situations, they end up not eating at all when the queue takes too long and fills the entire period before they could even order.
3. No program for calculation - Manual calculation of totals and change. This contributes to the time problem, and risks miscalculation alongside inefficient methods as they lack a program to make it easier.
4. Slow payment methods - As everything is manual, the student would take too long to order given the lack of a clear structure of ordering. Alongside this, labels aren't clear so it may affect the students choices.

 
## Step 3. Table
| Sub-problem | CT-Skill | Example Solution |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| No system for food stock | Pattern recognition | Monitor patterns and trends of sales and popular, high in demand items |
| Long queues | Decomposition | Identify the core reasons, lack of sufficient payment methods and factoring in student's personal decisiveness and environmental factors |
|  No program for calculation | Algorithmic Thinking |  Making a structured program or code for calculation. This includes the items, the prices, the input and the outputs |
|  Slow payment methods and ordering time | Algorithmic thinking | Structured steps for ordering and a clear, adaptable system |

## Step 4. Pseudocode

```bash
1. No system of tracking food stock

START
FOR each day:
   Record the quantity sold for every food item
   Record the quantity of each item remaining

FOR each food item:
   Compare sales across different days 
   Identify items with consistently high sales
   Identify items with consistently low sales

IF an item has high and consistent demand:
   Increase its expected stock the following day

IF an item has low and consistent demand:
   Decrease/retain the current stock the following day 

Repeat the process daily
END

2. Long queues

START
Identify possible causes of long queues:
   Check the number of available payment methods
   Check the time students spend deciding what to order
   Check if food labels and prices are clear
   Check if ordering area is organized
   Check if food space is sufficient

FOR each identified cause:
   Determine how much it contributes to the queue

IF there are insufficient payment methods:
   Add or improve available payment methods

IF students take too long to decide:
   Provide clear food labels, prices and menus

IF the ordering area is poorly organized:
   Improve the arrangement and flow of the area

IF the food space causes delays:
   Rearrange the space for easier movement

Repeat the observation and improvement process
END

3. No program for calculation (Both)

START

Display the list of food items and prices

INPUT selected food item
INPUT quantity

Calculate:
Item total = price x quantity

Repeat for every selected item

Calculate:
Total cost = sum of all item totals

INPUT payment method

IF payment method is digital:
Process digital payment

ELSE:
   INPUT amount paid
Calculate:
   Change = amount paid - total cost
   Display change

Display:
   Order summary
   Total cost
   Payment status

END

4. Slow payment methods and ordering times

START
Display the menu with food items and prices

Student selects food items

Display the selected items and total price

Student confirms the order

IF order is confirmed:
   Choose a payment method

IF digital payment is selected:
   Process digital payment

ELSE:
   Receive manual payment
   Calculate change

Confirm successful payment

Prepare the order

Notify the student when the order is ready
END
```
